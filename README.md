# Personal-Graph: A Knowledge Graph Library for AI

Personal-Graph is a Python library for creating, managing, and querying knowledge graphs. It aims to help solve working and long-term memory challenges in AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance and Reliability**: Built on top of libsql, a SQLite engine written in Rust
- üîå **Seamless Integration with Turso DB**: Efficient storage and retrieval of graph data
- üåê **Edge Computing Support**: Run personalized knowledge graphs for each user
- üîí **Data Privacy and Customization**: Each user has their own isolated database
- üåø **Modern and Intuitive API**: JSON validation and context manager/class wrapper
- üîç **Semantic Search and Natural Language Interfaces**: Powered by Sqlite-vss, Instructor, and Pydantic
- ‚ö° **Fast Read Performance**: Optimized for complex queries using libsql for local replicas
- ü§ù **Compatibility with Machine Learning Libraries**: Export functions for Networkx and PyG

## Installation

Install Personal-Graph using pip:
```sh
pip install personal-graph
```

## Usage

### Building a Working Memory for an AI

```python
from personal_graph import Graph

graph = Graph("your_db_url", "your_auth_token")

# Insert information into the graph
graph.insert(text="Alice is Bob's sister. Bob works at Google.")

# Retrieve relevant information from the graph
query = "Who is Alice?"
results = graph.search(query)

# Use the retrieved information to answer questions
print(f"Question: {query}")
print(f"Answer: Alice is Bob's sister.")

query = "Where does Bob work?"
results = graph.search(query)
print(f"Question: {query}")
print(f"Answer: Bob works at Google.")
```

In this example, we insert information about Alice and Bob into the knowledge graph. We then use the search method to retrieve relevant information based on the given queries. The retrieved information can be used as part of the AI's working memory to answer questions and provide context for further interactions.

### Building Long-Term Memory
```python
from personal_graph import Graph

graph = Graph("your_db_url", "your_auth_token")

# Insert information about conversations with the user over time
graph.insert(text="User talked about their childhood dreams and aspirations.", 
             attributes={"date": "2023-01-15", "topic": "childhood dreams", "depth_score": 3})
graph.insert(text="User discussed their fears and insecurities in their current relationship.",
             attributes={"date": "2023-02-28", "topic": "relationship fears", "depth_score": 4})
graph.insert(text="User shared their spiritual beliefs and existential questions.",
             attributes={"date": "2023-03-10", "topic": "spirituality and existence", "depth_score": 5})
graph.insert(text="User mentioned their favorite hobbies and weekend activities.",
             attributes={"date": "2023-04-02", "topic": "hobbies", "depth_score": 2})

# User queries about the deepest conversation
query = "What was the deepest conversation we've ever had?"

results = graph.search(query, sort_by="depth_score", descending=True, limit=1)

if results:
    deepest_conversation = results[0]
    print(f"Question: {query}")
    print(f"Answer: Our deepest conversation was on {deepest_conversation['date']} when we discussed {deepest_conversation['topic']}.")
else:
    print(f"Question: {query}")
    print("Answer: I apologize, but I don't have enough information to determine our deepest conversation.")
```
In this example, we insert information about different conversations with the user over time, including the date, topic, and a depth score indicating how deep or meaningful the conversation was. The depth score is assigned based on the perceived depth of the conversation, with higher scores representing deeper conversations.

When the user asks, "What was the deepest conversation we've ever had?", we use the search method to retrieve the conversation with the highest depth score. We set sort_by="depth_score" to sort the results based on the depth score, descending=True to sort in descending order (highest score first), and limit=1 to retrieve only the conversation with the highest depth score.

If a conversation is found, the AI responds with the date and topic of the deepest conversation. If no conversations are found or the depth information is missing, the AI provides an appropriate response indicating that it doesn't have enough information to determine the deepest conversation.

This example showcases how Personal-Graph can be used to build long-term memory about the user's interactions with the AI and retrieve specific information based on certain criteria, such as the depth of the conversation.

### Creating and Querying a Knowledge Graph
```py
from personal_graph import Graph, natural

graph = Graph("your_db_url", "your_auth_token")

nl_query = "Increased thirst, weight loss, increased hunger, and frequent urination are all symptoms of diabetes."
graph = natural.insert(text=nl_query)

search_query = "I am losing weight too frequently."
knowledge_graph = natural.search_from_graph(search_query)

print(knowledge_graph)
```

### Retrieval and Question-Answering
```py
import dspy
from personal_graph.graph import Graph
from personal_graph.retriever import PersonalRM

graph = Graph("your_db_url", "your_auth_token")
retriever = PersonalRM(graph=graph, k=2)

class RAG(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, depth=3):
        super().__init__()
        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=depth)
        self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateAnswer)

    def forward(self, question):
        context = self.retrieve(question).passages
        prediction = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)
        return dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=prediction.answer)

rag = RAG(depth=2)
answer = rag("How is Jack related to James?")
print(answer)
```
